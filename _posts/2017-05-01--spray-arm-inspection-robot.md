This robot is designed to operate as a fully automated inspection station for incjection molded parts coming out of a press. Parts are transferred into the inspection station by a press tending robot where they are then picked up by the inspection robot and presented to the vision camera in a series of coordinated positions. After inspection is complete parts are serialized and transferred to pass or fail collection areas.
