This is an automated machine that lifts and rotates 300lb batteries from a cart so that technicians can safety and easily install hardware on the backplate. The machine has several automatic features programmed in such as automatic cycle abort if a safety issue is detected, and automatic lift and rotate positons and velocities. Check out the video below for a typical cycle.
