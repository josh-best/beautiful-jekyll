This machine takes small solid parts and performs a series of calculated drilling cycles on them to drill various holes in them before offloading the completed parts to an inspection station. After a vision inspection the completed parts are offloaded and collected into pass-fail-rework bins at a rate of 720 per hour.
 
#### My Responsibilities
-	Consult with the customer in pre-design phase to develop a controls concept for the machine
-	Plan the interaction and timing of the various cycles and simultaneous functions
-	Plan and develop the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) program with 4 separate access levels (operator, supervisor, engineer, machine builder)
-	Develop and test code in a highly organized manner while the machine is being built
-	Commission and debug the machine in a methodical “bite-size” manner
-	Adjust features and timing as requested by the end customer
 
#### Programming Examples
-	Overall program structure that is easy to follow and maintain (pg 1)
-	Use object-oriented programming techniques where possible for ease of programming and troubleshooting (pg 36)
-	Calculation of pecking drilling positions for servos (pg 113-117)
-	Execution of peck drilling cycle (pg 121)
-	Inspection of complete parts (pg 189-197)
-	Develop a functional and simplified user interface for the operator
-	Develop a secured access UI for maintenance personnel and engineers
